# Frontend Mentor Challenge - Interactive rating component

## Creating a Interactive rating component with html, Sass and Javascript!
---

This project is an example that was created with Html, Sass and Javascript. I built the project without any external help or resources basically to test my knowledge in the tools mentioned previously. Parts of this Project are sample code which shows the following:

* Creating various breakpoints with Sass and using them to make items responsive on different screen size.
* Creating different button component with various hover states and adding them to the index.html.
* Using Javascript to manipulate items on the page.
* Adding items with Javascript on runtime.

### how it works

This is an interactive rating component that collects input from the user in the  component and returns that user input on a different component.
