## Project Purpose

This project was made to hone my knowledge on the basic structure of a website in html and css. It serves as my first full length project started from scratch. Since this project was a test of my knowledge, i used as little help resources as i could with the exception of debugging some css features such as the second container and assistance with flexbox.

This allowed me to see where my strengths where and which sections i needed to work on.


## Basic Structure
1. Home Page

## Sections

* Header (Navigation and Logo)
* Content
* Slider (carousel)
* Footer

## Hardest Sections & Lessons Learnt

The Layout and Slider was particularly difficult because prior to this project i had not used flexbox and a web tool to build a website, therefore i relied on positions to move content on the web page. This seemed like a good resolution until i got to the responsive part of the page and items started getting kicked out of position. A fix to this was to use a display of Flex and changing the flex-direction to Column at Mobile Screen.

## Final thoughts

This projects was not easy at all and the longer i worked on it, the more it took out of me. I started strong and i burnt out 80% of me through, with that being said, it has also been my favorite project so far because i did not rely fully on tutorials to complete it. i only used tutorials to understand smaller concept and not full sections.

I intend to comeback to this project someday to track my progress as a web dev. My goal is to learn how to design frontend projects in a straightforward and simplest way possible.
