## Clean Code reads like well-written prose.

> *"While comment are neither inherently good or bad, they are frequently used as a crutch. You should always write your code as if comments didn't exist. This forces you to write your code in the SIMPLEST, PLAINEST, MOST SELF-DOCUMENTING wa you can humanly come up with."* - ***JEFF ATWOOD***

### OBJECTIVE & AIMS

- This folder is mainly for my sketch work, i will be building several projects to hone my skills in HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.
- I'll also be using frameworks like SASS & REACT.

# NOTE
most of the coding style might be rough or not follow the proper conventions of the language at first but because the propose for this repo is to solely for personal practice and working to get better.
